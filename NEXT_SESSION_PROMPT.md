## CRITICAL MOBILE SSR DEBUGGING - CONTINUATION

**Please read MOBILE_SSR_DEBUG_HANDOFF.md first for full context.**

### Current Situation
The Arclight Intelligence website has a **critical mobile compatibility issue**:
- ✅ **Desktop**: Perfect (formatting + Contact button working)
- ❌ **Mobile**: Still blank screens despite SSR fixes
- ✅ **Server responses**: Identical complete HTML for both desktop/mobile

### What You Need to Do Immediately

1. **Read the handoff document**: `MOBILE_SSR_DEBUG_HANDOFF.md` contains all technical details

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

3. **Begin client-side debugging** since server-side is working:
   - The issue is likely JavaScript not executing on mobile
   - React hydration may be failing on mobile browsers
   - Asset loading might have mobile-specific problems

### Key Debugging Strategy
Since server responses are identical but mobile shows blank screens, focus on:

1. **JavaScript execution**: Check if JS runs on mobile
2. **Asset loading**: Verify `/@vite/client` and `/src/main.tsx` load on mobile  
3. **React hydration**: Test if React mounts properly on mobile
4. **Browser console**: Look for mobile-specific JS errors

### Immediate Actions
1. Test asset accessibility from mobile perspective
2. Add debug logging to main.tsx to track React mounting
3. Check mobile browser dev tools for errors
4. Verify Vite client script execution on mobile

### Recent Changes (Already Committed)
- Fixed environment-aware asset loading in `src/entry-server.tsx`
- Fixed Express middleware order in `server.js`
- Contact button functionality restored

The core SSR implementation is working (proven by identical server responses), so the issue is **client-side JavaScript execution specific to mobile browsers**.

**Start by confirming the development server runs, then focus on mobile JavaScript debugging.**
