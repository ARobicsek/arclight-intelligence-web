# Next Session: Fix Mobile Copyright Centering

## Current Issue
The copyright text in the footer is still not properly centered on mobile devices despite multiple CSS attempts. It appears slightly right of center.

## What We've Tried
1. Added CSS targeting `.footer-container .text-left` with `text-align: center !important`
2. Added more specific selectors like `footer .text-left` and `.footer-container .flex-col .text-left`
3. Added custom classes `copyright-container` and `copyright-text` with centering rules
4. Removed `padding-left: 8px` that might have been causing offset

## Current HTML Structure
```html
<div className="flex flex-col copyright-container" style={{paddingLeft: '8px'}}>
  <p 
    className="text-left copyright-text"
    style={{
      fontSize: '12px',
      color: '#666'
    }}

  </p>
</div>
```

## Next Steps to Try
1. **Remove Tailwind class entirely**: Change `className="text-left copyright-text"` to just `className="copyright-text"` 
2. **Use inline styles**: Add `textAlign: 'center'` to the inline style object to override everything
3. **Check parent container**: The issue might be with the parent flex container layout on mobile
4. **Inspect computed styles**: The Tailwind `text-left` class may have higher specificity than expected
