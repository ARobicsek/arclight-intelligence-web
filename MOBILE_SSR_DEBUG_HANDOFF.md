# Mobile SSR Debugging Session Handoff

## Current Status: CRITICAL MOBILE ISSUE PERSISTS

### Problem Summary
- **Desktop**: ✅ Working perfectly (formatting correct, Contact button functional)
- **Mobile**: ❌ Still showing blank screens despite SSR fixes
- **Server-side responses**: ✅ Both desktop and mobile get identical, complete HTML with styling

### What We've Already Fixed
1. **Environment-aware asset loading** in `src/entry-server.tsx:15-56`
   - Development: Uses `/@vite/client` + `/src/main.tsx`
   - Production: Uses `/assets/main-*.js` + `/assets/main-*.css`

2. **Express middleware order** in `server.js:29-38`
   - Static files now serve BEFORE SSR handler
   - Added explicit `/assets` route for production

3. **Contact button functionality** restored via React hydration

### Key Technical Details

#### Files Modified (Committed: 13f4c8a)
- `src/entry-server.tsx`: Environment-aware asset inclusion
- `server.js`: Fixed middleware order for static files

#### Server Response Analysis
Both mobile/desktop get identical responses with:
- Complete HTML structure with inline styles
- Proper meta tags and content
- All assets referenced correctly

#### Current Server Setup
- Development mode: `node server.js` 
- Production mode: `npm run serve` (sets NODE_ENV=production)
- Both modes return full HTML responses

### Critical Debugging Insights

#### What's Working
- ✅ SSR generating complete HTML responses
- ✅ Desktop browsers rendering properly
- ✅ Static assets accessible via curl
- ✅ React hydration working on desktop
- ✅ Contact button functionality

#### What's Still Broken
- ❌ Mobile browsers showing blank screens
- ❌ Despite identical server responses
- ❌ Issue appears client-side specific

#### Key Evidence
```bash
# Both return identical, complete HTML with styling:
curl http://localhost:3000/
curl -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone...)" http://localhost:3000/
```

### Next Session Strategy

#### Immediate Debugging Steps
1. **Client-side JavaScript debugging**
   - Check mobile browser dev tools for JS errors
   - Verify React hydration is occurring
   - Test asset loading in mobile browsers

2. **Asset loading verification**
   - Test `/@vite/client` accessibility on mobile
   - Verify `/src/main.tsx` loads properly
   - Check for CORS or loading issues

3. **Environment detection issues**
   - Verify NODE_ENV detection is working correctly
   - Test production vs development asset paths
   - Check if mobile gets wrong asset references

4. **Hydration debugging**
   - Add console.log statements to main.tsx
   - Verify React is mounting on mobile
   - Check for hydration mismatches

#### Advanced Debugging Tools
1. **Remote debugging**: Use Chrome DevTools for mobile debugging
2. **Network analysis**: Check actual asset requests from mobile
3. **Console inspection**: Look for JS errors in mobile browsers
4. **Hydration verification**: Add debug logs to React entry points

### File Locations
- Main SSR logic: `src/entry-server.tsx`
- Server configuration: `server.js`
- React entry: `src/main.tsx`
- React app: `src/App.tsx`

### Commands for Next Session
```bash
# Start development server
node server.js

# Start production server  
npm run build && npm run serve

# Test responses
curl http://localhost:3000/
curl -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 17_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/17.0 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1" http://localhost:3000/

# Check asset accessibility
curl http://localhost:3000/@vite/client
curl http://localhost:3000/src/main.tsx
```

### Hypothesis for Next Investigation
Since server responses are identical but mobile shows blank screens while desktop works, the issue is likely:
1. **Client-side JavaScript not executing** on mobile
2. **React hydration failing** specifically on mobile browsers
3. **Asset loading problems** that only affect mobile
4. **CORS or security policy** blocking resources on mobile

The fact that we get complete HTML with inline styles but still see blank screens suggests the JavaScript bundle isn't loading or executing properly on mobile devices.

### Critical Questions to Answer
1. Are there JavaScript errors in mobile browser console?
2. Is the Vite client script actually loading on mobile?
3. Is React attempting to hydrate on mobile?
4. Are there network failures when mobile tries to load assets?
5. Could there be a timing issue with mobile hydration?
